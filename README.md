Multi-class classification ML/DL model on the Fashion MNIST data.

Extract the datasets from Datasets.zip file in the same folder of the code before executing the code

Algorithms applied and their accuracy:
	Decision Tree: 79.21%.
	
	Logistic Regression: 85.8%.

	Naive Bayes: 71.41%.

	Random Forest: 85.31%.


Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier both gives almost 85% accuracy and can be considered in comparison to other ML Algorithms.


Also as the dataset is huge, we can use Neural Networks for the multiclass classification. Neural Networks give much better results when compared to basic ML Algorithms when dataset is used
Currently I am studying Deep Learning and know only binary classification of images so I am unable to implement a multiclass classification. I will be able to do the needful in some time.
